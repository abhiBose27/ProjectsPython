## About the Program

This Twitter Bot basically retweets and likes tweets based on given conditions.

In this program, since I am a Football fan and an Arsenal FC fan, the bot basically retweets and likes the tweets from 
Twitter handle @premierleague anything related to Arsenal.

1) First the user need to sign up for a developer account on Twitter to get the required keys to interact with the 
Twitter API.

2) The Bot can be deployed on the server using AWS. I used  
PythonAnywhere: Host, run, and code Python in the https://www.pythonanywhere.com.
