## About the Program

This Twitter Bot basically documents trending topics in a csv file. 
It takes a list of locations as an argument from CLI whose trends need to be documented.

1) First the user need to sign up for a developer account on Twitter to get the required keys to interact with the Twitter API.

2) The Bot can be deployed on the server using AWS. I used
